Tabs I'm going to open again
===
* [htop in the browser][7] - Looks cool but could be a security risk
* [run-when][8] - Run something when something changes
* [resty][9] - command like tools for interacting with REST apis
* [yaml][10] - [jq][11] for yaml (finally)

Tabs I've closed for now
====
* [Hidden Tracks][6] - Lamenting digital musics loss of the hidden track
* [Zero Theorem][3] - A Terry Gilliam movie I haven't seen
* [Testing with Bats][4] - About as simple as a test framework can get and still be useful

Tabs I've consumed
===
* [vim-go][1] - A go plugin for vim (works pretty well)
* [vim-go-ide][2] - A very opinionated vimrc (and modules) that sits next to your real .vimrc (works really well, but it's almost not vim)
* [Itsy Forth][5] - "Itsy Forth is a tiny indirect-threaded compiler for a subset of the Forth programming language. The compiler contains an interactive interpreter which allows the programmer to define new words (subroutines), execute them and even extend the language."
